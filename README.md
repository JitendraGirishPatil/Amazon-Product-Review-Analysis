## Problem Statement
It is observed that the maximum number of customers look at product reviews before they make a purchase. Survey results show that positive product reviews are a key factor for purchasing by 57% of Amazon buyers (Statista, 2019).

As product reviews are often the deciding factor for many customers, it’s very important to have a well-automated system for monitoring them.

The traditional manual process of Amazon product reviews is time-consuming and inefficient when millions of reviews are being posted all the time. It doesn’t show any trend or patterns over time. Moreover, it is tough to understand customers’ sentiment towards any product or its delivery.

## Approach
The Reviews are classified into 3 sentiments using VADER i.e Positive, Negative and Neutral. This project involve multiple techniques like Sentiment Analysis which is a technique used in Natural Language Processing that converts unstructured text into data that can be analysed. It is an emerging tool that helps businesses differentiate and categorize opinions about their products, services and brand image., Text Classification, Clustering and Time Series Analysis. 

In addition to this, this project can detect multiple language of the reviews and if not in engish language it can translate into english which can be helpful for further modelling. This project can recommend the products also based on its similarity with other products

We are analyzing the tone, language, keywords, and trends over time to provide valuable insights that increase the success rate of existing and new products as well as marketing campaigns.
